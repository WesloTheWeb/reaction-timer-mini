# reaction-timer-mini
This is just a simple Vue Application that is based on Reaction Timer. I made this to test out Vue 3 CLI and as practice. If someone
finds this and a way to improve it or add more features, please feel free to fork it over and put in a Pull Request (PR). Overtime,
I may add more to it.

For more information on Vue 3, refer to [official docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Simply press "Play" and be alert to click a button that will show up in X amount of time.
2. As this tests your reaction, there is no set amount of time.
3. Once you click the button, you will see how long it took for you to react.
